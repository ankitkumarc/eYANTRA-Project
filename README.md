We build the soil monitoring bot for deployment on an arena that abstracts an agriculture field . The brain of  the robot  is powered by an fpga (Field Programming Gate Array) that controls its sensors, actuators and pick-place mechanism. This bot helps us to check the quality of soil and find the needs for the soil.    
Tech-stack: verilog,dsa,wireless communication concept,fpga architecture etc.
In this theme, we build the SM Bot for deployment on an arena that abstracts an agriculture field.
It uses wired and wireless communication. We help teams build a sophisticated architecture using Verilog HDL to unveil the powerful parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs.
   Concepts Used : FPGA architecture, FPGA programming using Verilog HDL, Wireless communication concepts, building a bot using a real FPGA development board.
